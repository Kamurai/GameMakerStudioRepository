GAME MAKER EXTENSION CREATION
=============================

This zip file contains two programs that make
it possible to create extensions for Game
Maker version 7.0 and later.


The EXTENSION MAKER (version 1.2) is meant 
for creating extension packages. Extension
packages extend the possibilities of Game Maker.
They can be based on (combinations of) DLL files,
GML scripts, action libraries, and other files.
Please consult the help file for more information.

The Extension Maker produces a packed file
with extension .gex for the extension package.
The user can install these in Game Maker as
indicated in the documentation. 


The LIBRARY MAKER (version 1.3) is meant 
for creating action libraries. Action
libraries are used in combination with extension
packages to extend the possibilities of Game Maker.
Please consult the help file for more information.

The Library Maker produces a .lib file. You should
use the Extension Maker to produce an extension 
package out of this. The user can then install this
package in Game Maker to make the library available.


Extension packages will be made available on
